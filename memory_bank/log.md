# Activity Log

## 2025-11-29 - System Initialization Complete

### Phase 1: System Configuration
- ✅ Verified `.opencode/tool/` directory structure
- ✅ Configured repository path in `AGENTS.md` (D:\Github\OC_agent_tooling)
- ✅ Confirmed n8n server availability at http://10.1.1.101:5678/

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning
- ✅ Conducted requirements interview for 4 n8n integration tools
- ✅ Developed complete Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- ✅ Established environmental context (Windows/PowerShell, Node.js 18+)
- ✅ Created implementation plan with 5 epics and 20 stories

### Phase 3: Finalization
- ✅ Populated `memory_bank/brief.md` with complete specification
- ✅ Populated `memory_bank/context.md` with environment details
- ✅ Archived `SETUP.md` to `memory_bank/archive/SETUP_archived.md`

### Key Decisions Made
- **Tool 1 (docs_develop):** Async documentation synthesis with "big picture" focus
- **Tool 2 (ingest_url):** Async URL-to-Markdown conversion without content alteration
- **Tool 3 (research_quick):** Sync rapid search (~10 URLs, <30s)
- **Tool 4 (research_deep):** Async intelligent iterative research
- **Architecture:** Following "Hybrid Agentic Tooling" pattern
- **Environment:** Windows/PowerShell with Node.js 18+ and npm

### Next Steps
Ready to begin Epic 1: Documentation Development Tool
- Story 1: Create `n8n_listener.js` generic bridge script

## 2025-11-29 - Epic 1 Detailed Implementation Planning Complete

### Phase 1: Task Breakdown Development
- ✅ Created comprehensive Epic 1 implementation plan in `documentation/epic1_implementation_plan.md`
- ✅ Developed 23 atomic tasks across 5 stories with clear dependencies
- ✅ Established task sequencing and parallel execution opportunities
- ✅ Defined acceptance criteria and deliverables for each task

### Phase 2: Architecture Compliance Verification
- ✅ Conducted gap analysis against "Hybrid Agentic Tooling" pattern
- ✅ Verified compliance with governing principles and system architecture
- ✅ Identified critical gaps in error handling, logging, and testing strategies
- ✅ Validated tool integration approach with existing n8n infrastructure

### Phase 3: Plan Refinement
- ✅ Updated implementation plan to address identified gaps
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging requirements
- ✅ Enhanced testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- ✅ Strengthened documentation requirements for maintainability

### Key Achievements
- **Task Granularity:** 23 atomic tasks with clear scope and dependencies
- **Architecture Alignment:** Full compliance with "Hybrid Agentic Tooling" pattern
- **Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and error handling strategies
- **Implementation Readiness:** Clear roadmap with defined acceptance criteria

### Implementation Status
✅ **READY TO BEGIN EPIC 1 IMPLEMENTATION**
- All 23 tasks defined with clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies mapped and sequenced for optimal execution
- Architecture compliance verified and gaps addressed
- Testing and documentation strategies established

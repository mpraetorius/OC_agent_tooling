- LLM-powered documentation synthesis with research capabilities
- Full testing and validation workflow
- Complete documentation and deployment procedures

## 2025-11-29 - Epic 1 Detailed Implementation Planning Complete

### Phase 1: Task Breakdown Development
- ✅ Created comprehensive Epic 1 implementation plan in `documentation/epic1_implementation_plan.md`
- ✅ Developed 23 atomic tasks across 5 stories with clear dependencies
- ✅ Established task sequencing and parallel execution opportunities
- ✅ Defined acceptance criteria and deliverables for each task

### Phase 2: Architecture Compliance Verification
- ✅ Conducted gap analysis against "Hybrid Agentic Tooling" pattern
- ✅ Verified compliance with governing principles and system architecture
- ✅ Identified critical gaps in error handling, logging, and testing strategies
- ✅ Validated tool integration approach with existing n8n infrastructure

### Phase 3: Plan Refinement
- ✅ Updated implementation plan to address identified gaps
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging requirements
- ✅ Enhanced testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- ✅ Strengthened documentation requirements for maintainability

### Key Achievements
- **Task Granularity:** 23 atomic tasks with clear scope and dependencies
- **Architecture Alignment:** Full compliance with "Hybrid Agentic Tooling" pattern
- **Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and error handling strategies
- **Implementation Readiness:** Clear roadmap with defined acceptance criteria

## 2025-12-02 - Workflow Specification Development Complete

### Phase 1: Input Format Resolution
- ✅ Resolved discrepancy: Updated from "Software package name" to "llms.txt URL"
- ✅ Confirmed llms.txt approach provides comprehensive developer resources
- ✅ Updated `memory_bank/brief.md` with corrected tool specifications

### Phase 2: Comprehensive n8n Workflow Specification
- ✅ Created `documentation/docs_develop_llms_workflow_specification.md`
- ✅ Designed 11-node n8n workflow architecture with full async processing
- ✅ Implemented error handling, retry logic, and quality assurance mechanisms
- ✅ Prepared test case: https://www.langflow.org/llms.txt

### Story 3 Outcome
- **Status:** ✅ Complete - Specifications ready for implementation
- **Deliverables:** Complete technical documentation and workflow design
- **Next Step:** Ready for n8n workflow implementation and testing
